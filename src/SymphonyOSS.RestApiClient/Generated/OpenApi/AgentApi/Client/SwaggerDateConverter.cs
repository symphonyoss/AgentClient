 * Agent API
 *
 * This document refers to Symphony API calls to send and receive messages and content. They need the on-premise Agent installed to perform decryption/encryption of content.  - sessionToken and keyManagerToken can be obtained by calling the authenticationAPI on the symphony back end and the key manager respectively. Refer to the methods described in authenticatorAPI.yaml. - Actions are defined to be atomic, ie will succeed in their entirety or fail and have changed nothing. - If it returns a 40X status then it will have sent no message to any stream even if a request to aome subset of the requested streams would have succeeded. - If this contract cannot be met for any reason then this is an error and the response code will be 50X. - MessageML is a markup language for messages. See reference here: https://developers.symphony.com/documentation/message_format_reference
