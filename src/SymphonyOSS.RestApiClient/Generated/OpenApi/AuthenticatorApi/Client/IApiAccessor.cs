 * Authenticator API
 *
 * For bots and other on-premise processes to authenticate. Once authenticated, the bot will be able to use the methods described in serviceAPI.yaml and agentAPI.yaml.  Connections to the servers will be over client authenticated TLS, the servers for this API will perform the authentication by inspecting the certificate presented by the SSLSocketClient.  There will be two implementations of this API, one on your Pod and one on the Key Manager. In order to fully authenticate, an API client will have to call both of these implementations and pass both of the session tokens returned as headers in all subsequent requests to the Symphony API.
