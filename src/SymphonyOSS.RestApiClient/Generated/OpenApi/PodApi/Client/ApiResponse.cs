Refer to the methods described in authenticatorAPI.yaml. - Actions are defined to be atomic, ie will succeed in their entirety or fail and have changed nothing. - If it returns a 40X status then it will have made no change to the system even if ome subset of the request would have succeeded. - If this contract cannot be met for any reason then this is an error and the response code will be 50X.
